I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science, Aalborg University. I obtained the Ph.D. degree from Aalborg University (Department of Computer Science) in 2022 (advised by Prof. [Hua Lu](https://luhua.ruc.dk/)). My research generally concerns graph search, spatial database, data management, and data science. Recently, I have been working on Queries for Indoor Location-based Services (LBSs). My current work focuses on AI-based approaches for search on large graphs.
