I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at Aalborg University Copenhagen (AAU CPH). I am in the Data Engineering, Science and Systems ([DESS](https://www.cs.aau.dk/research/dess-data-engineering-science-and-systems/about-dess)) group headed by Prof. [Christian S. Jensen](https://csj.cs.aau.dk/). 
I obtained the Ph.D. degree from Aalborg University (Department of Computer Science) in 2022, advised by Prof. [Hua Lu](https://luhua.ruc.dk/). My research generally concerns graph search, spatial database, data management, and data science. Recently, I have been working on Queries for Indoor Location-based Services (LBSs). My current work focuses on data analysis related to moving-object mobility.
