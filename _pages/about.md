I am a PhD fellow in the Department of Computer Science, Aalborg University (advised by Prof. [Hua Lu](https://luhua.ruc.dk/)). I obtained my BSc (Department of Communication Engineering) and MSc (Department of Computer Science and Technology) degrees from Jilin University, China.

My research generally concerns data management, spatial database, data science and data mining. Recently, I have been working on queries for indoor location-based services (LBSs). My current work focuses on AI for shortest path query which is aim to improve the performance of query processing using AI models.
